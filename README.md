# The Novelist
##### Overview: A branching narrative authoring simulator that uses a [sorting hat](https://emshort.blog/2019/11/29/storylets-you-want-them/) storylet approach to have the player write and publish their own novel.

## Subject Matter
I believe that the best writing is evoked from personal experiences. This storylets project is a personal reflection of the type of writer that I am. And my aim was to allow the player to step into an author's shoes and work through the process of authoring their own novel. Two of the novels that the player is able to write and publish in *The Novelist* are ones that I've already written myself. One of them, *Portrait of a Psychopath*, was not published for reasons the player will discover in the story. The other, *A Father's Signs*, is a deeply personal novel that I have published, which you can find [here](https://www.amazon.com/Fathers-Signs-Dennis-Moss-ebook/dp/B07Y4X2PKF/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=a+father%27s+signs+dennis&qid=1581752378&sr=8-2). The motive for writing this novel in the game is the same motivation I had for writing it. Almost a year ago, I lost my father to cancer. And, if I'm being totally honest, I wasn't coping well at all. My therapist suggested that I begin writing, which I was very hesistant to do at first. Then, I was later faced with other overwhelming emotions on top of my grief and depression that I decided to spend the rest of my summer, the two months I had left, to write a novel about my feelings towards the turmoil I was going through. The novel became a work of fiction that translated everything I was experiencing into the life of the book's main protagonist, Desmond. Therefore, this piece is more than just seeing what it's like to write and publish a novel. It's about understanding the thought processes behind certain author's written works and also seeing the pitfalls that may occur in the process. 

## Technical Medium
In this branching storylets narrative, I was very heavy on providing content. I used an array in the TOML data language file to store the descriptions for both the introduction and each of the storylet choices. This allowed for multiple chunks of descriptive text to appear on the page. And to make the branching narrative pathways in a sorting hat fashion possible, I used "conflict" and "requires" parameters within each individual storylet structure to eliminate other options, so that the player was required to make a key decision. I also modified the HTML file in the base code, providing a p tag (<p>/<p>) under the HTML body to write out instructions for the player to be aware of prior to gameplay. I felt the inclusion of instructions were a necessary addition, especially to those that are unfamiliar with how storylets operate. Another major addition was the use of personally designed cover art for the novels, which were attached as the final element of the description array of the TOML file under image tags, presented to the player at the very end of the experience. The CSS code was also widely modified, but more on that in the next section. 

## Artistic Technique
This project is filled with more artistry than I originally intended to feature. As mentioned previously, I designed my own covers for the novels that the player can author in the game using the free graphic design tool, [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). The player now has a visual representation of the story that was being written, as it now reveals itself at the end with the rest of the text. I heavily modified the CSS base code to present a project that aesthetically fits the theme of the subject matter and is more pleasing to the eye. I eliminated the marginal borders from the body of the story description container and title container, so that each chunk of text flows smoothly together as though they were part of the same page (to really capture that book page feel). The color of the web page background changed to a "lavender grey", which richly offsets the new color I gave to the text chunks (white smoke, or #F5F5F5). The narrative descriptions have the same color of a fresh book page, now that they're blended with the current background color. The buttons that hold the various storylet options have also been changed to have sharperned corners and colored a darker shade of grey to distinguish between text and choices while keeping the same authentic color scheme. When you hover your mouse over the button options, the color will now change to a "tan beige." This is to also introduce the color of an older book page. I also purposefully changed the font style of the descriptive text and the choice buttons to a hand written font to emphasize the authentic writing feel (as if the player is penning the words with each click), using selective imports from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). The increased font size of the buttons was likewise done to match the rest of the text. Playing creatively with the art portion of this project, I learned a lot of new skills in CSS and HTML that aid in web design. And this knowledge I can take with me for future endeavors.
